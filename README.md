## Demystifying Brain-Computer Interfaces: An Introductory workshop
 

### Workshop Overview
This workshop is designed to introduce neophytes to the fascinating world of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). 
Participants will gain hands-on experience with EEG data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning 
techniques used in BCI applications.
Most importantly, this workshop aims to demystify the concepts and technologies behind BCIs, making them accessible
to beginners.

No hype, no jargon, just practical knowledge and skills.
